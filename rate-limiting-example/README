Rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of traffic that a system receives by limiting the rate at which requests can be made. It is commonly used to protect web services from being overwhelmed by a large number of requests, which can cause the service to become unavailable or slow down significantly. Rate limiting typically involves setting a limit on the number of requests that can be made within a certain time period, and rejecting requests that exceed this limit. This can help to ensure that a service remains available and responsive to legitimate users, while also preventing abuse and protecting against malicious attacks.
